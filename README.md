# CandyCrush_in_Masm611_Assembly

I wrote code for this assembly project wih MASM-611 syntax in VS-Code and I ran it using the MASM/TASM extension.
I also changed the settings of the extension, for the assembler I used MASM-v6.11 and for the Emulator I used dosbox.
I hope this helps you in furthering your quest to learn assembly.
